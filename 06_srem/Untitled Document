Your mission
Time to think again about our dear computer memory. Let's save some RAM with a delete method for Set values. As you can see, everything that doesn't exist or is not a Set should be consider already deleted.

def srem(key, value):
    """Remove `value` in the set associated to `key`
    >> put("toto", "tata")
    >> sadd("numbers", 28)
    >> srem("numbers", 28)
    >> smembers("numbers")
    {}
    >> srem("numbers", 28)
    >> srem("toto", 28)
    >> srem("not_existing_key", 28)
    """
