07_return_values
Phewww! It was tough but we have a pretty good redintek. Still, it feels like something is missing... It lacks some developer-loveâ„¢. ðŸŒ´

Coding is not a purely solitary job - some people will use your functions or read your code, and your job is to be as nice as possible to them. That's why you should only use self-descripting function names, self-explanatory variable names (not 'a' or 'b' !), and you should return a useful "return value".

So let's change our existing functions :

put should now return the new value (it's better than returning nothing !)
delete should now return True or False depending on if it really deleted something
incr and incrby should now return the new value (useful to avoid another get call)
sadd should return the value just added (once again, not super useful but better than returning nothing)
srem should now return True or False depending on if it really deleted something
ðŸŒˆ Clean code makes developers happy, clean code makes the world a better place ðŸŒˆ
