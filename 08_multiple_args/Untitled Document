Your mission
Can we improve the developer-loveâ„¢? Let's add support for multiple arguments to some of our functions. Believe me, anybody using your code will mentally thank you for that.

delete
delete should now take at least 1 argument (and up to as many as we want). It will return the number of actual deletions.

>> put(1, 'one')
>> put(2, 'two')
>> put(3, 'three')
>> delete(2, 1, "not_existing_key", 1)
2

sadd
sadd should now take at least 2 arguments: the key, and n (at least one) values. It will return the number of insertions.

>> exists('singers')
False
>> sadd('singers', 'Michael Jackson', 'Madonna', 'Elvis', 'Madonna')
3
>> smembers('singers')
{'Elvis', 'Madonna', 'Michael Jackson'}

srem
srem should now take at least 2 arguments: the key and n (at least one) values. It will return the number of actual deletions.

Isn't it more convenient to use?

>> exists('singers')
False
>> sadd('singers', 'Michael Jackson', 'Madonna', 'Elvis', 'Madonna')
3
>> srem('singers', 'Madonna', 'Justin Bieber')
1
>> smembers('singers')
{'Elvis', 'Michael Jackson'}
