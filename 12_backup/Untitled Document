Your mission
At the beginning of this series, we said that Redis is an in-memory database by default. But you can specify it to store everything in a file, in case the program crashes or stops for any reason.

Do you see where this is going ?

Let's add a way to backup your database in a file and then read it back next time!

Example


$python
>>> import redintek
>>> redintek.put("toto", "tata", ex: 60)
"tata"
>>>exit()
$python
>>> import redintek
>>> redintek.get("toto")
"tata"
>>>exit()
$sleep 60 ; python
>>> import redintek
>>> redintek.get("toto")
None
>>>

That's all folks...
Here we are! Your very own Redis(-light) made by you!
