Your mission
Ok, we should be careful now - because every time we add a key/value to our database, the database size will increase. Since our RAM is not unlimited, let's add a way to delete a specific key!

Your computer will thank you!

def delete(key):
    """Delete the key from the database
    >>> delete("toto")
    >>> delete("not_existing_key")
    >>> delete(83)
    """
