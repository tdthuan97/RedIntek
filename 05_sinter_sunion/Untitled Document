Your mission
It was fun, wasn't it? Let's now add some tools for our new Sets. We need 2 new functions :

sunion will give us a Set of all elements that are in different Sets. sinter will give us a Set of all elements that are shared between different Sets.

For those functions, a non-existing key will be considered as an empty Set.

def sunion(key1, key2):
    """Return all elements present accross both Sets
    >> sadd('actors', 'Leonardo DiCaprio')
    >> sadd('actors', 'Will Smith')
    >> sadd('actors', 'Scarlett Johansson')
    >> sadd('singers', 'Madonna')
    >> sadd('singers', 'Will Smith')
    >> sunion('actors', 'singers')
    {'Will Smith', 'Scarlett Johansson', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Madonna'}
    """

def sinter(key1, key2):
    """Return all elements shared between both Sets
    >> sinter('actors', 'singers')
    {'Will Smith'}
    """
