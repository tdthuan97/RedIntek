Your mission
Time for some accounting !

We want functions to count things - this will be useful to track things like the number of times a specific function is called (could be useful for optimization... !). The incr and incrby functions will help us do that.

If the key doesn't exist yet, it will be added to the database and set to 0 before the incr or incrby operation is performed.

Of course, you have to be careful: only integers and floats can be incremented.

(As you may have noticed, incr is a special case of incrby. Maybe you can reduce the amount of code by having one function call the other?)

def incr(key):
    """Increment the value associated to `key` by one
    >>> exists("my_counter")
    False
    >>> incr("my_counter")
    >>> get("my_counter")
    1
    >>> put("toto", "tata")
    >>> incr("toto")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: Incorrect value
    """

def incrby(key, delta):
    """Increment the value associated to `key` by `delta`
    >>> incrby("my_counter", -10)
    >>> get("my_counter")
    -9
    """
