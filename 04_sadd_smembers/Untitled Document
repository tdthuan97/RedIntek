Your mission
Good job, we now have an implementation of basic commands. Our redintek is starting to look good!

Now we are going to add functions to use Sets in our database. First, we will add sadd and smembers.

sadd will add the provided value to the set. If the key doesn't exist, it is created; if the current value associated to the key is not a set, it will be replaced by the new set. smembers will return all the values associated to a key, without changing the default order of the set.

Beware, a set only contains unique values... but you knew that, right?

def sadd(key, value):
    """Add `value` to the set associated to `key`
    >>> exists("staff")
    False
    >>> put("staff", "STAFF")
    >>> sadd("staff", "Daniel")
    >>> sadd("staff", "Laurie")
    >>> sadd("staff", "Laurie")
    """

def smembers(key):
    """Return the set values associated to `key`
    >>> smembers("staff")
    {'Daniel', 'Laurie'}
    >>> smembers("not_existing_key")
    None
    >>> put("a", "A")
    >>> smembers("a")
    None
    """
